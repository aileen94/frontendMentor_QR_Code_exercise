## Overview
In this repo I implemented my solution to the QR challenge from the page ftonendMentors. I tried it to do as good as possible with the little knowledge I have so far ;-)

## My process
Basically I had a look at the design to see how it should look like and started with the easier parts to add the image and format the text the right way. After that I researched how the css style was done and then I tried to reproduce as good as I could. Since my knowledge with HTML and css are not very deep, I had to research quite a while, especially for the right tags an styles to use. 
### Built with

- HTML
- inline CSS


### What I learned

I learned that I need to learn some more CSS styles because a lot of the time I took for implementing was try and error to see what needs to be adjusted and to find out the right value for it. Also I had a short look on how to make a side responsive for smaller screens. While my solution might not be perfect, I hope it is the first step in the right direction.
